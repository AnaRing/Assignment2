# Assignment2

Object Oriented Programming

For this task we are supposed to utilize Object-oriented programming
to make a Pharmacy Inventory Management. We are supposed to store different kinds of data,
display it, be able to delete it and ensure that it stays in the local storage when page is refreshed.

The specific data that needs to be stored for each medicine:
• Product name (for example: Paracetamol, etc.)
• Product ID (must be a unique ID)
• Manufacturer
• Expiration date (iso 8601 format)
• Quantity 

With ES6 classes, inheritance and form validation. 

This assignment really was the bane of my existence, because I had to troubleshoot it so many times after having to redo it
bc of me making it without inheritance the first time around. Neither I, nor chatGpt was able to find the error, after checking about
a hundred times - so what I did in the end was rewrite the entire javascript file - and managed to get it working correctly.
